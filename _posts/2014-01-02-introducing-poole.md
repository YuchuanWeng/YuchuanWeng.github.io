RealTimeThing is the blog for [RTB](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@yuchuan](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently two themes built on RealTimeThing:

* [RTB]()
* [IoT]()
